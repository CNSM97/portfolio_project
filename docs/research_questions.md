# Research Questions & Hypotheses

## Research Questions
1. Which factors (GDP, social support, health, freedom, corruption, generosity) are most strongly associated with happiness across countries?
2. How do happiness levels differ across regions, and how have these differences evolved over time?
3. Has the importance of specific factors (e.g., GDP vs. social support) changed between 2005–2023 and 2024?
4. Which countries consistently rank among the top 5 and bottom 5 in reported happiness levels, and how stable are these rankings over time?
5. To what extent did major global events — such as the COVID-19 pandemic — affect reported happiness levels across countries?

## Hypotheses
- H1: GDP, social support, and health are the strongest predictors of happiness scores.
- H2: There are systematic differences in average happiness scores between regions, reflecting underlying economic, social, and health-related conditions.
- H3: The relative importance of GDP compared to social support has shifted over time.
- H4: Generosity has little to no explanatory power for happiness scores.
- H5: The years 2020–2021 show a statistically significant drop in Life Ladder relative to trend, controlling for predictors.
